1) Create a new rails application and call it alpha-blog
2) Ensure you can run the server and preview the application
3) Create a pages controller within it (create a new file called pages_controller.rb instead of the welcome_controller.rb). Similarly, the folder's name will be "Pages" instead of "welcome"
4) Ensure you have appropriate routes
5) Create a homepage, about and make sure you can link them
